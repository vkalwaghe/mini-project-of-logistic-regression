> **Logistic Regression Mini Project - 1**

**Overview:**
This project focuses on implementing logistic regression using two datasets: Titanic and Pima Indians Diabetes. Logistic regression is a widely used machine learning algorithm for binary classification problems.

**Features:**
Utilized logistic regression for predictive modeling.
Analyzed the Titanic dataset to predict survival based on various features.
Explored the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to predict diabetes occurrence.

**Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/vkalwaghe/logistic-regression-mini-project.git

**Usage:**
Open the Jupyter notebooks ([titanic_logistic_regression.ipynb and pima_indians_diabetes.ipynb](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/mini%20proect_1%20-%20categorical-classification-logistic%20regression.ipynb)) in a Jupyter environment or any compatible platform.
Run the cells in the notebooks to execute the code and see the results.
Feel free to experiment with the code and modify parameters for further exploration.

**Datasets:**

**-Titanic Dataset**
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers and their survival status.
Columns include features like age, sex, ticket class, etc.

**-Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**
The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset involves predicting the onset of diabetes based on various health-related features.
Features include glucose concentration, blood pressure, BMI, etc.

**Results:**
Provide insights into the model performance on both datasets.
Discuss any challenges faced during the implementation.
Include visualizations and metrics to showcase the results.
